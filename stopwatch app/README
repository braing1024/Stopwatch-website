# Digital Stopwatch

A simple, elegant digital stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic timing functionality with a modern interface, including start, pause/resume, and reset features.

## Demo

You can try the stopwatch by opening `index.html` in your web browser.

## Features

- **Start Timing**: Begin the stopwatch with the 'Start' button.
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily stop and resume timing with the 'Pause' button (toggles to 'Resume' when paused).
- **Reset**: Clear the timer back to 00:00:00 with the 'Reset' button.
- **Real-Time Display**: Shows elapsed time in HH:MM:SS format, updating every 100ms.
- **Button States**: Buttons are dynamically enabled/disabled based on the stopwatch state.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Button hover and click effects for a polished user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

No additional dependencies or setup required – it's pure vanilla JavaScript!

## Usage

- Click 'Start' to begin timing.
- Click 'Pause' to stop the timer temporarily (button changes to 'Resume').
- Click 'Resume' to continue from where it paused.
- Click 'Reset' to stop and reset the timer to 00:00:00.

The display updates in real-time while running.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the stopwatch interface.
- **CSS3**: Styling, gradients, transitions, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic for timing, event handling, and DOM updates.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the stopwatch layout.
- `script.js`: JavaScript code for stopwatch functionality.
- `style.css`: CSS styles for design and interactions.

## Limitations

- No support for lap times or split timing.
- Time display is in seconds only (no milliseconds).
- No keyboard shortcuts.
- Basic functionality; does not persist time across page reloads.
